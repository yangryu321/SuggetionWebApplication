## About the website
Tools I used to build the website: </br>
*Full-stack framework* : asp.net core Blazor server side. </br>
*Database* : MongoDB Atlas. <br/>
*Hosting* : Azure. <br />
*Authentication* : Azure AD B2C <br/>
*Other tools* : Bootstrap 4, etc. <br />
*Readme* : This website is a fully functional wishlist website that has 3 access priorities: tourist, member, admin. <br />
Please sign up or email me for admin access to fully explore the infrastructure of this website. :hear_no_evil:

## What I learned 
### *About Blazor and asp.net core* : 
Since Blazor is relatively new compared to MVC and Razor page, it has some really handy features for modern<br/>
web development. What I really like about blazor is first the routing. It is very clear and straightforward. <br /> 
I also like how you can use razor components where you can inject classes at the top of the pape to simplify <br/>
coding process. Having frontend code and c# code on the same page makes it easier for me to debug ( Of course<br/>
you can put the c# code in another file to make it look like the razor page infrastructure). MVC and razor page <br/>
make you understand better about how asp.net core works, but when it comes to overall development experience I <br/>
like Blazor the best. Combining it with Azure AD B2C makes the whole development process faster and easier. </br >

### *About database*  : 
It is my first time using NoSQL database. I really like it even though I didn't take advantage of EF core's </br >
features like scaffolding and  migration. It feels more like using Dapper with SQL to me and I like Dapper a lot. <br/>
The overall use of mongoDB is easier than using SQL. You dont have to worry about duplicated data as long as it's <br/>
not too absurd. I think I'll use MongoDB more from now on if I build something from scratch and not want to worry <br/>
too much of it being rational or not.<br/>

## *About Auth* :
First time using a third-party authentication system. It is easier to configure than using the built-in <br/>
authentication system (Even though the set up part on Azure is kinda messy). The coding part is especially <br/>
easier than implementing JWT from scratch by myself. The only thing I think users wouldn't like about it is <br/>
the system UI. It looks very Microsoft and not custom enough even though you can change the icon and background <br/>
picture. But overall it's really handy if you build a project from scratch and want something easier and faster. </br >
You dont have to worry too much about authorization and security as it is being handled by Microsoft.
<br>
<br>


## Epilogue
Learned a lot from building this website. Struggled for a while to deploy it online but eventually figured it <br/>
out after three days. Compared to Razor Page and MVC I think I like Blazor the best because it's really fast <br/>
and straightforward. I also like Azure AD B2C, the downside is that it's not free after a year and it handles <br/>
50000 monthly with the free tier azure (more than enough for my website :rofl:). MongoDB is nice too as there is <br/>
no more DBContext stuff all you need is a dependency injection using a mongoDB client. I did implement responsive <br/>
design in this website but somehow the virtualize box is not working properly. Have to fix that later so for now just </br >
use the desktop version lol

*(Please open the website on your computer and give it 15 to 30 seconds to load the website and database as it <br/>
is being hosted on free tier Azure and Atlas. Please sign up to leave your ideas about what you want in Street <br/>
Fighter VI if you like the series. :blush: <br/>
The mobile version is still in development.)*
